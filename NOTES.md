"I think we should do something like what Freelancer does, but make people stake YES or BTC or something when they start a job
And if they fail to complete it or meet X criteria, they lose it
well, when they start a task I should say
I think a cool goal would be to make this for basically anything
Need someone to walk your dog? Send them some YES
I know this can all be done with BTC or ETH
But I just want a cool project to work on
I don't expect it to be used much outside of our community and some extreme crypto heads
I was thinking something like instead of having to memorize an address or use a QR code or something, we just let them use a username (address will work too though ofc)
It'd be neat to be able to add a /ping function to it too so that if people gave the app GPS perms or whatever, it could just list usernames nearby that were accepting payment (when the time came for payment ofc, it wouldn't list any other info about the person)"
